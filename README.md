# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of my **machine learning projects** developed during my learning journey.  
The projects cover areas such as **regression, classification, clustering, deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), and experimental applications**.  

Some projects make use of the **OpenAI API**, however due to security reasons the API keys and certain code parts are not included here.
